OBS NGINX RTMP
=====================

This Dockerfile installs NGINX configured with `nginx-rtmp-module`, ffmpeg
and some default settings for HLS live streaming.

How to user
-----------

1. Build and run the container (`docker build -t obs-nginx_rtmp .` &
   `docker run -p 1935:1935 -p 8080:80 --rm nginx_rtmp`).

2. Stream your live content to `rtmp://localhost:1935/encoder/stream_name` where
   `stream_name` is the name of your stream.

3. In Chrome, VLC or any HLS compatible browser / player, open
   `http://localhost:8080/hls/stream_name.m3u8`. Note that the first time,
   it might take a few (10-15) seconds before the stream works.
